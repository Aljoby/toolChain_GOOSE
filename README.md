# toolChain_GOOSE


This project describes a set of attack senarios that might happen during a communication of IEDs in a substation using the GOOSE protocol. We construct this with Python scripts by encdoing and decoding of GOOSE packets into a scapy, a popular Python program that enables the user to sniff, dissect, forge and send network packets. 
The possible senerios of attacks are defined in an XML file called "xmlFile.xml" and can be extend there as well.
